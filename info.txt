Add randomized delays and human-like behavior:

Add random mouse movements and scrolling:

Implement session management and rotation:

Add stealth mode configurations:

Implement request throttling:

Additional recommendations:

Rotate IP addresses (using proxies)
Implement exponential backoff for retries
Add delays between sessions
Use different user agents

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or show how to implement them in more detail?
